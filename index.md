# Installation

## Requirements

You need PHP >= 7.1 to use Habemus Container.

### Composer

Composer is the recommended method of installing Habemus. Make sure you have the current version of Composer and then import the Habemus package for your project.

```shell
composer require brenoroosevelt/habemus
```

Then, don't forget to import Composer autoloader into your bootstrap script:

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

# Getting started

After installation, you need an instance of Habemus Container. Usually a single container is used for the whole application. It is often configured in the application's bootstrap script.

```php
<?php
use Habemus\Container;

$container = new Container();
```

## Registering services

Containers are typically implementations of the Service Locator pattern. You can register anything into the container: services, references, arrays, settings, strings, numbers, etc. To register your services just call the method `add(string $id, $value)`, like this:

```php
<?php

// Interface and its implementation (instances will be resolved by container)
$container->add(UserRepositoryInterface::class, RedisUserRepository::class);

// Some (resolved) service 
$container->add('SomeService', new SomeService());

// Numbers
$container->add('my_secret_number', 123);

// Strings
$container->add('my_string', "Hi, I'm using Habemus Container");

// Array settings
$container->add('settings', [
    'my_config' => 'value'
]);

// Closure factory
$container->add('stdCreator', fn() => new stdClass());
```

## Requesting services

Habemus is a PSR-11 compliant implementation. Therefore, to request container services, simply use the `get(string $id): mixed` method. You can check services by calling the `has(string $id)` method to avoid a NotFoundException.

```php
<?php

$repository = $container->get(UserRepositoryInterface::class);
$settings = $container->get('settings');

// checking for services
if ($container->has('stdCreator')) {
    $newStd = $container->get('stdCreator');
}
```

Ok, everything seems very simple so far, we only have three methods (`add` `has` `get`), and a standard behavior of Service Locator pattern, but we can go further.
Habemus is more than just an implementation of Service Locator pattern. So what if you need to decouple your class dependencies and inject them where they are needed? Don't worry, Habemus got you covered!

## Container options

* By setting `$container->useAutowire(true|false)`, 
* By setting `$container->useAttributes(true|false)`, ...
* By setting `$container->useDefaultShared(true|false)`, ...
