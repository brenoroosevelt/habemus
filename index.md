# Installation

## Requirements

You need PHP >= 7.1 to use Habemus Container.

### Composer

Composer is the recommended way of installing Habemus. Make sure you have the current version of Composer and then import the Habemus package for your project.

```shell
composer require brenoroosevelt/habemus
```

Don't forget to import Composer autoloader in your bootstrap script:

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

# Getting started

After installation, you need an instance of Habemus Container. Usually a single container is used for the whole application. It is often configured in the application's bootstrap script.

```php
<?php
use Habemus\Container;

$container = new Container();
```

## Registering services

Containers are typically implementations of the Service Locator pattern. To register your services just call the `add(string $id, $value)` method, like this:

```php
<?php

// Interface and its implementation (instances will be resolved by container)
$container->add(UserRepositoryInterface::class, RedisUserRepository::class);
// Some (resolved) service 
$container->add('SomeService', new SomeService());
// Numbers, strings, arrays
$container->add('my_secret_number', 123);
$container->add('my_string', "Hi, I'm using Habemus Container");
$container->add('settings', ['my_config' => 'value']);
// Closure factory
$container->add('stdCreator', fn() => new stdClass());
```

## Using Container

Habemus is a PSR-11 compliant implementation. So, to get a service, just use the `get(string $id): mixed` method. You can check services by calling the `has(string $id): bool` method to avoid a NotFoundException.

```php
<?php

$repository = $container->get(UserRepositoryInterface::class);
$settings = $container->get('settings');

// checking for services
if ($container->has('stdCreator')) {
    $newStd = $container->get('stdCreator');
}
```

Ok, everything seems very simple so far... we only have three methods (`add` `has` `get`) and a standard behavior of Service Locator pattern.
Habemus is more than this, and we can go further. So what if you need to decouple your class dependencies and inject them where they are needed? Don't worry, Habemus got you covered!


## Auto wiring

Auto wiring is enabled by default and you only need to ask for an instance.

```php
<?php

class Foo {}

class Bar
{
    public function __construct(Foo $foo) {}
}
```
```php
<?php
// No registration required; no configuration:
$bar = $container->get(Bar::class); 
var_dump($bar instanceof Bar); // true
```
When `Auto wiring` is enabled, Habemus Container is able to resolve instances of objects and their dependencies by inspecting type hints in the constructors. No configuration is required.

## Interfaces and Abstract Classes

Consider the scenario below:

```php
<?php

interface FooInterface {}

class SimpleFoo implements FooInterface {}

class SpecialFoo implements FooInterface {}

class Bar {}

class MyClass
{
    public $foo;
    public $bar;
    
    public function __construct(FooInterface $foo, Bar $bar)
    {
        $this->foo = $foo;
        $this->bar = $bar;
    }
}
```

When is dealing with an interface, the container is unable to resolve the dependency. In the example below, the container does not know how to resolve an instance of FooInterface and will throw an exception.

```php
<?php

$container->get(FooInterface::class); // NotFoundException
$container->get(MyClass::class);  // UnresolvableParameterException
```
In this case, you need specify how container will resolve instances of FooInterface: 

```php
<?php
// contanier will try to resolve with an instance of SimpleFoo
$container->add(FooInterface::class, SimpleFoo::class);
// or you can use a specify instance:
$container->add(FooInterface::class, new SimpleFoo() );
// or a factory
$container->add(FooInterface::class, fn() => new SimpleFoo()); 

$foo = $container->get(FooInterface::class);
var_dump($foo instanceof FooInterface); // true
var_dump($foo instanceof SimpleFoo); // true

$myClass = $container->get(MyClass::class);
var_dump($myClass->foo instanceof SimpleFoo); // true
var_dump($myClass->foo instanceof SpecialFoo); // false
```
Now, container will always resolve FooInterface instances with a SimpleFoo object, but you can use a specific instance in a particular class:
```php
<?php

// a specific instance for MyClass:
$container->add(MyClass::class)
    ->constructor('foo', new SpecialFoo());
// or a reference to another service:
$container->add(MyClass::class)
    ->constructor('foo', Container::use(SpecialFoo::class));

$myClass = $container->get(MyClass::class);
var_dump($myClass->foo instanceof SimpleFoo); // false
var_dump($myClass->foo instanceof SpecialFoo); // true

$foo = $container->get(FooInterface::class);
var_dump($foo instanceof SimpleFoo); // true
```

## Primitive types

As with interfaces, the container cannot resolve primitive types in the constructor.

```php
<?php
class MyClass
{
    public function __construct(int $min, int $max) {}
}
```

```php
<?php

$container->get(MyClass::class); // UnresolvableParameterException
```

In this case, you need to specify constructor parameters for primitive types:

```php
<?php

$container->add(MyClass::class)
    ->constructor('min', 1)
    ->constructor('max', 50);
// or a reference to another services in the container:
$container->add(MyClass::class)
    ->constructor('min', Container::use('config_min'))
    ->constructor('max', Container::use('config_max'));
```

## Container options

* By setting `$container->useAutowire(true|false)`, 
* By setting `$container->useAttributes(true|false)`, ...
* By setting `$container->useDefaultShared(true|false)`, ...
