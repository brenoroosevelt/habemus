# Installation

## Requirements

You need PHP >= 7.1 to use Habemus Container.

### Composer

Composer is the recommended method of installing Habemus. Make sure you have the current version of Composer and then import the Habemus package for your project.

```shell
composer require brenoroosevelt/habemus
```

Then, don't forget to import Composer autoloader into your bootstrap script:

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

# Getting started

After installation, you need an instance of Habemus Container. Usually a single container is used for the whole application. It is often configured in the application's bootstrap script.

```php
<?php
use Habemus\Container;

$container = new Container();
```

## Registering services

You can register anything into the container: services, references, arrays, settings, strings, numbers, etc. To register your services just call the method `add(string $id, $service)`, like this:

```php
<?php

$container->add(UserRepositoryInterface::class, RedisUserRepository::class);
$container->add('SomeService', new SomeService());
$container->add('my_secret_number', 123);
$container->add('my_string', "Hi, I'm using Habemus Container');
$container->add('settings', [
    'my_config' => 'value'
]);
```


## Container options

* By setting `$container->useAutowire(true|false)`, 
* By setting `$container->useAttributes(true|false)`, ...
* By setting `$container->useDefaultShared(true|false)`, ...
